// *********** Style Guide  ***********

// Low-level (styling format)
// BEM inspired styling - although with sass's feature to nest modifiers and variants it isn't necessary for the __ & -- prefix
// mixins, states, variants, component

// Medium-level (components & layouts)
// Still within scss style sheets (inputs, buttons) (img - content, forms, grids)

// high-level (sections)
// svelte template files
